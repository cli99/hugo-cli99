# Biography

I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a member of the [IMPACT Research Group](http://impact.crhc.illinois.edu/) led by Professor Wen-Mei Hwu.

Currently I am working on [MLModelScope(CarML)](https://github.com/rai-project/carml) as part of the IBM-ILLINOIS [Center for Cognitive Computing Systems Research (C3SR)](https://www.c3sr.com/). MLModelScope is an open-source framework and hardware agnostic, extensible and customizable platform for evaluating and profiling ML models across datasets/frameworks/systems, and within AI application pipelines. Available at [mlmodelscope.org](http://mlmodelscope.org/). Details at [MLModelScope: Evaluate and Measure ML Models within AI Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09737).
