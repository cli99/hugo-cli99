# Biography

I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a member of the [IMPACT Research Group](http://impact.crhc.illinois.edu/) led by Professor Wen-Mei Hwu.

I am working on CarML (Cognitive ARtifacts for Machine Learning) as part of the joint UIUC / IBM C3SR cognitive computing systems research center. CarML is an open source distributed platform allowing people to easily deploy and experiment different Machine Learning / Deep Leaning frameworks and models, all through a common interface.
