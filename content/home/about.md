# Biography

I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a member of the [IMPACT Research Group](http://impact.crhc.illinois.edu/) led by Professor Wen-Mei Hwu.

I am working on [MLModelScope(CarML)](https://github.com/rai-project/carml) as part of the joint UIUC / IBM C3SR cognitive computing systems research center. MLModelScope is an open-source batteries-included platform allowing users to easily evaluate Machine Learning / Deep Leaning algorithms(models) across different datasets, frameworks, and systems, all through a common interface. A prototype is [here](http://mlmodelscope.org/).
