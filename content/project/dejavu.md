The existing techniques for Deep Learning performance estimation use theoretical information of model and machine specifications to estimate execution time, which are very simplistic modeling and not accurate. We propose to leverage both theoretical and historical information to estimate timing and resource utilization for Deep Learning trainning and inference. The key is to develop "Performance Similarity" analysis to map the "unknown" performance to the "known" historical evaluation.

This project is under active development.
